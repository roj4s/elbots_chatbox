# Elbot's Chat Box

  ![demo](./data/demo.gif)

Elbot is an eloquent and witty bot developed by [Artificial Solutions](https://www.artificial-solutions.com/). Didn't like much its original UI so I implemented my own using React and Redux.

## Talk with Elbot

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## TODO

 - Turn it into a PWA with push notifications, so Elbot will send you messages when you least expected (or when you most need it).
 - Deploy to Heroku.
 - Integrate several other bots.
 - Support to message-embbeded html tags, sometimes Elbot responds with some HTML.
 - Enhance palette
 - Write tests
